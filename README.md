 Some useful Oraxen python script \
 \
 This repository contain some useful scripts to generate Glyph/Armor/Items/etc config for Oraxen.
## Features
 * Easy to use \
 Sure, OraxenScript is very easy to use, as it's question based. It will ask you about how your item will look, how your item behave and do you want to add "etc" to your item or not. It's very easy, and pretty straight forward too. A GUI version and a Web version that will be available soon will even made it even more easier to use.
 * Accurately generated configs \
 OraxenScript will generate a very accurate and bug-free config for you, so that you can copy it to your current config and your item will appear in game with everything you have configured. You could also tweak the item config afterwards to make it fit your needs even more.
 * Fast and No Time Consuming \
 Focus on what matter instead of spend hours reading the wiki, implementing everything by hand and troubleshooting everything afterwards. OraxenScript help you add new content to the game faster. \
 **Please note that OraxenScript will not help you skipping the whole learning process. Please at least try to made things by hand first so when you are running into trouble we can help you.**
